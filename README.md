# Signature
One-Shot Learning: Signature Verification using Siamese Networks 
Domain: Biometrics | Type: One-shot image classification | Model: Siamese Network 
Project Description: 
Design and implement a Siamese neural network for verifying whether two input images 
(signatures or fingerprints) belong to the same person. The model should be trained using 
contrastive or triplet loss, learning a robust embedding space suitable for biometric verification. 
✅ Tasks: 
 Preprocess and augment the dataset to handle class imbalance and noise. 
 Build and train a Siamese network using shared CNNs for encoding image pairs. 
 Evaluate using verification accuracy and ROC curve (AUC is a plus). 
 
 Signature Verification Dataset: CEDAR Signature Dataset 


Final Model Evaluation: Training Accuracy: 0.9688 , Validation Accuracy: 1.0000 , Test Accuracy: 1.0000
